 * store asset information
 * topo scanner: do not scan each host in a network
 * reduce the zoo of types (exec steps vs actions vs probe). The current
   implementation is too complex, and many settings are evaluated too late for
   timely error reporting.
 * have a "local" address enumerator that loops through all local networks
 * improve on the netid idea
 * perform send rate limiting based on class C networks so that we're
   not running into gateway ICMP rate limit problems with unreachable
   hosts.
 * use nanosecond timestamps for measuring RTTs

Other probes to implement
 - A host probe that uses invalid protocol numbers to elicit a response
 - A host probe using TCP, UDP, SCTP to a well-known port
 - (for locally connected networks): ARP and IPv6 NDISC probes

Gauge resource needs of a probe
 - "I may trigger an ICMP error" (-> ICMP rate limits apply)
 - "I may trip TCP SYN flood protection" (-> TCP SYN rate limits apply)
 - "I need to open a socket" (-> file desc limits apply)

UDP source port setting
 - we could do this at the probe level, but this doesn't sound right
 - we could introduce per-protocol options, and allow stuff like
   "for all UDP probes, use source ports in the range of 30000-40000"
 - similarly, we could use one or more globally shared UDP sockets
   that are bound to a fixed port, such as 53.

Dealing with fdesc limits
 - increase the limit to max (setrlimit(NOFILE))
 - count the open fds by scanning /proc/self/fd
 - add info to probes on whether they will need additional sockets
    * default: 1 socket for each probe
    * but account for shared sockets (eg icmp raw)

Local IPv6 target discovery
 - broadcast ICMPv6 probe to ff02::1. Pick local address from different
   prefix to elicit responses using different addrs from other nodes
